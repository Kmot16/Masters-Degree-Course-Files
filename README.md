## Hello, I'm Katia
I have a clinical research background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Data & Business Analytics (University of North Carolina Wilmington). I graduated with a 4.0 in May 2022. 
 
I have worked 7 years in the Clinical Research Organization world playing roles as a Project Analyst I and II for the Project Management Office (PMO). Where I developed data analysis, reporting, and visuals for the executive management team. I have been a Global Data Analyst II working on the implementation and processing of data types since October 2021.
 
Prior to that I work in Commercial Real Estate for 3 years. Working for large clients running analysis and market research on best locations for new retail locations or offices.
